# 📊 Sentiment Analysis of Blu Bank App on Play Store Using Machine Learning

## 📝 Project Description
This project aims to analyze user sentiment toward the **Blu Bank** app on **Google Play Store** using **Machine Learning** techniques. By leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, this project classifies user reviews as **positive, negative, or neutral**, providing valuable insights for app developers to enhance user experience.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Web Scraping**: Collect user review data from Google Play Store.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, tokenize, and normalize text for analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilize algorithms like **Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), or BERT** for sentiment classification.
- **Model Evaluation**: Measure accuracy using metrics such as **precision, recall, and F1-score**.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Google Colab** for model experimentation
- **Flask** (optional) for deploying sentiment prediction API
